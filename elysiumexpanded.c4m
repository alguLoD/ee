# For those wondering why I separate the descriptions from the monsters and rituals themselves - call it superstition. I once had a missing description for a ritual despite said description being present under the ritual itself, and doing that fixed it. It may be - and is likely - that it was something else I did that fixed it, but ever since...

descr "Some students at the academy suffer are known to suffer from deficient attention spans, or else complain about the difficulty of their studies and how they wish they had stayed with their families and become knights instead.

They fight like cavalrymen but are usually more prudent and prefer to charge into battle only after they have softened the enemy up and properly prepared themselves."

descr "The Rephaim do not possess a natural afterlife, and it is thought that the Sheol Temples whose existence is purported by mostly reliable necromancers constitute an invasion of the natural order.  Ordinarily the souls of the giants have nowhere to go after death.  Instead, they remain trapped within their bones forever.  It is said that they suffer terribly over the first few centuries before they calm down and grow surprisingly amicable.  Their bones are sometimes revealed by the shifting sands of the southern deserts in which the Rephaim were known to roam in the Time of Giants.  They have turned to stone, a phenomenon some scholars believe is entirely ordinary but others insist is a trait unique to the bones of the Rephaim themselves.  The necromancers who dwell among living descendants of these giants are known to sometimes bring them back to unholy service.  Were any servant of Ba'al ever worthy of pity, it would be these, and destroying them is doing them a service."

When the Celestial Powers lashed out in fury, the Watchers were banished to the Infernal realms where they still linger, fettered by bonds of iron tempered in the blood and tears of those slain by their gifts of civilization."

selectmonster "Oni"
descr descr "Oni are ugly, wild demons with pot-bellies and unkempt hair.  They come in different colors and with different abnormalities, but red or green skin with a pair of horns or an extra eye or ear seem to be the most common variants.  Although all Oni enjoys striking people with large clubs, most of them are also capable of dealing pain using their demonic magic.  The Oni have a great appetite and consume all the food and drink they can get hold of.  However, food is also their weakness as they cannot pass a line of carefully arranged potatoes.  Putting a few potatoes on the doorstep is an effective way to keep the Oni out, but on the other hand beasts and especially Bears might be attracted by the potatoes instead."

selectmonster "Goblin Mountain King"
descr "To be king among goblins is a title of dubious value.  Maybe it will add up to something if you are king of really many Goblins. The Goblin Mountain king is a vassal of the famed Troll King. He is known to hate giants and often rallies his warriors to trap and slay them, but these attempts rarely seem to even hurt the giants. Regardless, the Goblin mountain king would likely not remain in the Troll King's service were he to bring lots of giants to his swampy court."

newmonster "Goblin Warrior"
copystats "Goblin"
descr "Goblins are cowardly creatures of low morals and limited intelligence that like to skulk around in the forests where they can stay hidden from their foes.  The Goblins would be totally harmless if it weren't for their strange alliance with the Trolls.  The Trolls can find the Goblins with their excellent sense of smell and this is the foundation for the alliance.  The Goblins serve the Trolls and in return the Trolls don't kill all the Goblins."

In contradiction to certain popular folk tales, however, there is no apparent relationship between the two races."

The origin of these accoutrements are a mystery, as they clearly cannot have been made specifically for the giant, but there also are no other creatures known for which they would fit given their reputed size. Supposedly this giant has declared himself a king among his fellows, much as his smaller brethren call themselves barons. We would dismiss his existence entirely were it not for the tireless work of our student interrogators on captured goblins. They are terrified of the giant and he is said to devour their kind by the handful as a deer would eat berries."

descr "The smallest of the Giants lives in small tribes that often raid our farmlands.  Having had a close relationship with Trolls and Hill Giants, they have developed a dire craving for human flesh, but in being more cunning than their cousins, they often execute well planned raids on human villages or waylay travelers at crossroads in order to fill up their larders. Some of them seem to prefer deer, boar, and other wildlife. As a trend it could be worthy to encourage through carefully direct social manipulation, but they never seem to hesitate to use their crudely-fashioned spears on humans as well. Ogre poachers consider themselves highly intelligent and are very proud of the fact."

The Seraphines are Airya women who would be very beautiful if not for their wings.  Many laymen seem to consider them beautiful anyway, though they tend to retract these statements under questioning by Inquisitors.  It is commonly suggested that Airya men are sterile as a side-effect of the armour they wear and so the Seraphine are really much like Jahi or Succubi and must seduce human men for the Airya to proliferate.  Mentioning this aloud in the presence of any Airya or devotee of the Spentas is not recommended."

descr "The white-winged Airya serve the Spentas and are said to descend from Yazata who have lain with mortal women.  The warriors of the Airya are known as the Iceclad.  This is a very literal name since their weapons and armor are both made from a kind of enchanted ice.  They wield lances and a wing of Iceclads (which is what the Airya call a squad without the slightest trace of irony) flying right over conventional fortifications is a terrifying sight.  As for their armor, it is reputedly not very comfortable, however, and while the magic ice is nearly as hard as steel even on a warm summer day, it will partially melt.  It will start to drip and soak the wearer through, which is reportedly very uncomfortable and shown to be very irritating."

Their bows are made of ordinary wood but the arrows they use are magical and if you are struck by one you will not be happy, as the icy arrowheads will burst into a mist so cold it would probably kill you by itself."

classdescr "Before men arrived in Elysium, a people known as the Tur lived in the southernmost deserts of Terra.  These were a fierce and war-like people split into many petty kingdoms which warred ceaselessly with one another.  Their kings are known as Shahs.  When Ba'al made himself manifest they were his first victims, but several of the Shahs led the remainder of their people to Elysium.^^The Shah lacks the administrative acumen of the Baron and the technology available to him is not quite as advanced, but his warriors are flexible and can fight both at a distance and in close quarters.  When the elephants of Elysium were discovered to be one of the few friendly animals native to Elysium they were soon tamed and repurposed for war.  They can trample through enemy lines and serve as mobile towers for archers.^^Mage-priests of the old faiths supplement that Shah's forces.  They are divided into two orders.  The Athravans venerate the Yazads and Spentas, while the Karapans venerate the Daevas.  Both orders are united in their veneration of fire.  While they no longer war actively with one another, the two orders refuse to work side-by-side with one another.^^Abilities:^Starts in a very well fortified citadel.^Diverse troops including expendable Paighans, elite and flexible Zhayedans and Cataphracts, and massive War Elephants.^Depending on the circumstances the Shah may opt to align himself with either the Athravans and Yazatas in turn or with the Karapans and their Daeva masters. The mage-priests are flexible and can cast spells from two different paths. Both use pyromancy, while the Athravans can also use storm magic and the Karapans can use blood magic.^The Athravans collect all sorts of gems to summon Daevas.^The Karapans collect sacrifices to summon Daevas."
