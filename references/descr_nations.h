Abysians are stronger than humans and use very heavy armor and weaponry. Bows are not used, because they would burn to cinders in the glowing hands of the Abysians. The war machine of Abysia also includes Salamanders, lizardlike beings composed of the same hot lava-born flesh as the Abysians. The Anointed of Rhuax and the Anathemant Priests of the Flame Cult practice blood sacrifice to strengthen the power of the Awakening God. The Warlocks of the Smouldercone, a newly formed magical order, practice Blood magic and search for suitable blood slaves in conquered lands. Abysians prefer to live in extremely hot places. They do not farm or hunt for a living, so their income and supplies are not affected by the Growth or Death scale of a province.

The Avvim were a people strong and beautiful of mind and body. They were adept students and their culture flourished under the tutelage of the Grigori, the angelic Watchers. But before long the Angels became enamored with the Avvim and taught them things that should not be taught. Tempted by the beauty of the Avvim, they took their daughters as wives and sinned before the Celestial Powers. Their offspring were the Nephilim, giants of godlike power, abominable to the world. The Angels were imprisoned in the Infernal Realms for their sins, but the Nephilim were partly of this world and could not be banished by the Celestial Powers. The Nephilim made themselves kings over the Avvim, and they fathered sons who became known as the Rephaim.

Those who survive the winter are allowed to return to their family.\nThe barbarians of Ulm live in small settlements ruled by chieftains and warrior smiths who search for the Enigma of Steel. Steel is a sacred metal and its maker is as well. Smithing has become the equivalent of making a sacrifice to the Lord and no other culture has developed such skill in forging magical items.\nHorses are rare and those who use them in warfare are held in contempt. Sneak attacks, on the other hand, are common, and many warriors use stealth to engage opponents in hand-to-hand combat.",

The mines of Ulm are famous for their riches and the smiths of Ulm work the iron into the blacksteel armor used by the knights and infantry of Ulm. The people of Ulm are heavily built by human standards. Their infantry use full chain or plate armor made of blacksteel. The feared Black Knights of Ulm are the most heavily armored troops known to man. The leaders of Ulm have never approved of magic and only the Master Smiths are allowed to use it. The smiths are used to working in conditions that are magically unfavorable and are therefore not adversely affected by provinces that have a strong Drain dominion. The smiths craft armor and weaponry for lords and kings, but the strength of steel is preferred over magic. Even religion is of secondary importance in Ulm, though an Iron Cult that worships steel in a more devout fashion has emerged in recent times.",

The secrets of blacksteel were forgotten. An order of Black Priests emerged in Ulm in the last days before the civil war. They formed an Iron Cult, consolidated their position and forbade the use of magic. Magic outside religion was announced to be sacrilegious and the few surviving Master Smiths were put to the flames.

With the corruption of the purifying flame the Daevas as well as the Yazatas were banished from this world. With the disappearance of the Yazatas the three tribes were dispersed and fled their homelands. But when some Yazatas reemerged from hiding, the three tribes gathered and settled in the high mountain range where the last of the Eagle Kings resided. The former tribes are now known as the Tempest Clan of Spire Horn Mountain, the Raptor Clan of Raven's Vale and the Airyas of High Caelum. The Spire Horn Caelians are partially resistant to cold and lightning. The Raptorians are stronger and attuned to the Earth, but lack the elemental resistance characteristic of the other clans. The Airya once lived in the land of the White Forest where winter lasts for ten months. They still live in the coldest mountain peaks and are unaffected by low temperatures. Their priestesses try to purify the taint of the daevas and are keepers of the sacred flame of the White Forest. The Airya Seraphs craft magical ice that the many Caelians use instead of regular metal. The ice tempers with lower temperatures and the heavy ice armor is more durable in cold climates than in warmer ones. All weapons crafted from the ice are magical and capable of harming magical beings. The Caelians are skilled archers and prefer hit-and-run tactics, even though they do have some heavy troops, such as huge Mammoths.",

 "Caelum is a magocracy of winged humanoids who inhabit the highest mountain peaks. In ancient times, there were three Caelian clans led by semi-divine beings known as Yazatas. The Raptor clan was accepted by the Yazatas even though they were held responsible for the corruption of Catharsis. When the Harab Seraphs of the Raptor clan began to study dark magic once more, the purifying flames were tainted and Catharsis remained Anthrax, King of Banefires. As a result many of the Seraphines died from a wasting disease and their sacred task was abandoned. The Harab Seraphs were condemned and civil war broke out. The Raptor Clan was banished and scattered across the world. The last of the Eagle Kings disappeared and were replaced by the High Seraphs of the Airya clan.

But the war with Ashdod had been taxing and the colony was cut off from the kingdom by a Arcoscephalean campaign through the fertile lands previously conquered from the giants. For centuries Tur was left alone and an independent kingdom formed. Then came the Caelians. A great host of iceclad warriors descended upon the Turan armies on the plain of Ragha in the mid of winter. The Turan Shah realized that Tur could not stand up to the Caelians for long. Tur was on the brink of destruction when the attacks suddenly stopped. Civil war had broken out in Caelum and the campaign was aborted. Instead Caelian refugees and deserters settled on the plain of Ragha. Airyan Seraphs approached the Turan Shah and peace was negotiated. When the Harab Seraphs of Caelum attacked, the Airyas were saved by the Gryphon riders of Tur. This sealed the truce and a strange alliance was formed. Ragha is now a society of two peoples united out of necessity. During winter the Airya reigns and during summer the Tur reigns. Even faith has evolved to mimic the legacy of the two peoples.

The necromantic practices of the Raptor clan were not banned in Nazca and the divine kings were mummified and preserved, should their advice be needed in the future. Priests of the dead began to mummify other influential members of society as well. Since old kings and queens were supposed to be wiser than the living, a council of mummies was formed to aid and guide the Incas. The priests would listen to the mummies and divine their will. Now Nazca has turned into a necrocracy, a kingdom ruled by mummies of the silent council. The Sun Kings rule in their name, but it is the mummies of ancient kings and their interpreters who have the true power in the kingdom.

":era1 Yomi",
"Yomi is a land of inhospitable mountains, steaming, sulphuric pools and sudden volcanic eruptions. At the center of this unforgiving land lies a great cone-shaped mountain at the top of which is an entrance to the Netherworld. From this gate the Oni have come, one by one or in small groups. Oni are demons of the wild, ugly, pot-bellied and mischievous. They are ruled by Oni Kings who occasionally emerge from the Netherworld to wreak havoc on the land of the living. Oni are almost immortal and must be killed in spirit as well as in body to stay dead.",

":era2 Shinuyama",
"When the entrance to the Netherworld closed, the Oni became fewer and fewer. Their Bakemono slaves and human servants rebelled, and when the last of the Dai Oni died, the realm was taken over by Bakemono Kings. Human smiths were forced to reveal the secrets of metalcraft and the Bakemono have become ready to conquer the lowlands from the humans. The Bakemono still live in a tribal society ruled by the strongest and most powerful of their kin. The Bakemono are a diverse kind. Huge lumbering O-Bakemono, proud Dai-Bakemono, strange shapeshifters and ghostly apparitions all heed the call of the Bakemono Kings and the Awakening God.",

":era3 Jomon",
"The rice fields of Jomon were the first to be attacked by the Bakemono onslaught. After years of slavery and mistreatment, the human inhabitants rebelled as the Bakemono had once rebelled against their Oni masters. One by one the Bakemono tribes were replaced by human Daimyos and their sworn warriors. A strict, feudal warrior society replaced the disorganized rule of the Bakemono Kings. Even war has become ritualized and peasants are left largely in peace. With the coming of the God, the Daimyos have joined forces and look for other realms to conquer.",
