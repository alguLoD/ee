description "A mod that seeks to tweak and expand on the game without changing its spirit or creating terrible imbalance."
# For those wondering why I sometimes separate the descriptions from the monsters and rituals themselves - call it superstition. I once had a missing description for a ritual despite said description being present under the ritual itself, and doing that fixed it. It may be - and is likely - that it was something else I did that fixed it, but ever since...

# TODO Teaser image

# TODO Investigate whether new things get IDs assigned to them automatically. This would vary with the mods you had installed, of course, leading to incompatibility if they were not designed to work in tandem. (You can have some mods earlier but that only works if all the mods load in a sane order.)

Master smiths are stereotyped as stout and gruff, and due to their skills it is a widespread belief that they all have dwarven blood. This is obviously impossible to anyone who is familiar with dwarven reproduction and who consequently experiences considerable consternation when this myth is mentioned in their vicinity."

Ordinarily the souls of the giants have nowhere to go after death.  Instead, they remain trapped within their bones forever.  It is said that they suffer terribly over the first few centuries before they calm down and grow surprisingly amicable.  Their bones are sometimes revealed by the shifting sands of the southern deserts in which the Rephaim were known to roam in the Time of Giants.  They have turned to stone, a phenomenon some scholars believe is entirely ordinary but others insist is a trait unique to the bones of the Rephaim themselves.  The necromancers who dwell among living descendants of these giants are known to sometimes bring them back to unholy service.  Were any servant of Ba'al ever worthy of pity, it would be these, and destroying them is doing them a service."

descr "In a primeval era of antiquity the god Ba'al incarnated for the first time and made the world taste fear and destruction.  Even Angels succumbed under the sway of his will and sinned.  Azazel was the leader of the Watchers and the first one to be seduced by the will of Ba'al.  He convinced his brethren to join him and they swore a pact that they would all commit to sin.  The Watchers took wives among men and begat the Nephilim, giants of almost godlike power.  Azazel taught his children of warcraft and cosmetics.  When the Celestial Powers lashed out in fury, the Watchers were banished to the Infernal realms where they still linger, fettered by bonds of iron tempered in the blood and tears of those slain by their gifts of civilization."

selectmonster "Oni"
descr descr "Oni are ugly, wild demons with pot-bellies and unkempt hair.  They come in different colors and with different abnormalities, but red or green skin with a pair of horns or an extra eye or ear seem to be the most common variants.  Although all Oni enjoys striking people with large clubs, most of them are also capable of dealing pain using their demonic magic.  The Oni have a great appetite and consume all the food and drink they can get hold of.  However, food is also their weakness as they cannot pass a line of carefully arranged potatoes.  Putting a few potatoes on the doorstep is an effective way to keep the Oni out, but on the other hand beasts and especially Bears might be attracted by the potatoes instead."

selectmonster "Goblin Mountain King"
descr "To be king among goblins is a title of dubious value.  Maybe it will add up to something if you are king of really many Goblins. The Goblin Mountain king is a vassal of the famed Troll King. He is known to hate giants and often rallies his warriors to trap and slay them, but these attempts rarely seem to even hurt the giants. Regardless, the Goblin mountain king would likely not remain in the Troll King's service were he to bring lots of giants to his swampy court."

The Goblins would be totally harmless if it weren't for their strange alliance with the Trolls.  The Trolls can find the Goblins with their excellent sense of smell and this is the foundation for the alliance.  The Goblins serve the Trolls and in return the Trolls don't kill all the Goblins."

The origin of these accoutrements are a mystery, as they clearly cannot have been made specifically for the giant, but there also are no other creatures known for which they would fit given their reputed size. Supposedly this giant has declared himself a king among his fellows, much as his smaller brethren call themselves barons. We would dismiss his existence entirely were it not for the tireless work of our student interrogators on captured goblins. They are terrified of the giant and he is said to devour their kind by the handful as a deer would eat berries."

Having had a close relationship with Trolls and Hill Giants, they have developed a dire craving for human flesh, but in being more cunning than their cousins, they often execute well planned raids on human villages or waylay travelers at crossroads in order to fill up their larders. Some of them seem to prefer deer, boar, and other wildlife. As a trend it could be worthy to encourage through carefully direct social manipulation, but they never seem to hesitate to use their crudely-fashioned spears on humans as well. Ogre poachers consider themselves highly intelligent and are very proud of the fact."

newmonster "Shah"
descr "The Turanic peoples are broadly divided into a number of tribal kingdoms.  The tribes are loosely organized and the leading elders and chiefs have little direct power, but each recognizes and heeds the authority of a single Shah.  A Shah usually rules over several tribes and takes a wife from the ruling caste of each, and many, particularly those who worship the Daevas, take numerous concubines from each tribe and from conquered peoples as well.  The Shah passes his title and power down to a favoured son, though it is not always the case that all his sons and all the subject tribes approve of his choice.  This usually results in a great deal of trouble and may be the reason why there is more than a single Shah to begin with.^^While most Shahs have many sons, few have many brothers.  The Shah himself is usually one of the fiercest warriors in the kingdom.  The Shah is clad in a suit of ornate enchanted armor passed down for many generations and seems to be warded against both fire and thunder.  The source of the armor is unknown as it protects against the magics used most commonly by both the Daevas and Yazatas."

newmonster "Spahbed"
descr "The Spahbed is a Turan general of high birth, though the Turan military hierarchy is very meritocratic.  While armed much like the High Lords of more civilized lands, the Spahbeds seem to be much more clever as they also carry bows and will fight like horse archers instead of knights.  The Turans seem to consider this behaviour wise but strangely enough it is also considered honorable.  The Turans reason that a leader that dies on the field of battle fails his army and his people.  Consequently there are a lot of nobleborn Turans which is probably why the position of Spahbed is based on merit.  Most nobleborn warriors join the armies as cataphracts instead."

They are said to have discovered and cultivated a species of exotic nut known as the peanut, which the Elephants adore.  The peanut farms are a vital asset to the Turan warmachine and so their locations are well-guarded secrets.  Entire villages are founded around these and entire generations live and die without ever seeing the outside world, dedicated to the care of the peanuts.  This is probably to their benefit since the outside world is very dangerous."

They dress in white and gold, though some confused souls insist that their robes are actually black and blue.  The Athravans collect gems which are used in sacred rites and also to ravens.  Ravens act as psychopomps in their religion, where the treatment of the dead is quite ghastly.  The dead are left exposed in tall, hollow towers from where they are quite literally taken by a variety of avian creatures.  Cremation is considered sacriligeous and in these days the Turans no longer have any neighbours which practice it."

newmonster "Airya Seraph"
descr "The white-winged Airya serve the Spentas and are said to descend from Yazata who have lain with mortal women.  They are ruled by mages known as Seraphs who really have nothing to do with the Seraphim.  They are powerful mages of storm and frost.  Curiously they do not appear to be considered sacred nor, since it is not thought to be holy in the religion of the Athravans to smite unbelievers with bolts of lightning, do they appear to have any religious duties."

newmonster "Seraphine"
descr "The white-winged Airya serve the Spentas and are said to descend from Yazata who have lain with mortal women.  The Seraphines are Airya women who would be very beautiful if not for their wings.  Many laymen seem to consider them beautiful anyway, though they tend to retract these statements under questioning by Inquisitors.  It is commonly suggested that Airya men are sterile as a side-effect of the armour they wear and so the Seraphine are really much like Jahi or Succubi and must seduce human men for the Airya to proliferate.  Mentioning this aloud in the presence of any Airya or devotee of the Spentas is not recommended."

descr "The armaments of the Airya warriors are produced by a very specialized caste of mages known as Icecrafters.  The weapons and armor they create are nearly so fine as those of the dwarven Runesmiths, at least when the weather is cold.  When the need is dire they can turn their talents to much more direct uses."

newmonster "Airya Iceclad"
descr "The white-winged Airya serve the Spentas and are said to descend from Yazata who have lain with mortal women.  The warriors of the Airya are known as the Iceclad.  This is a very literal name since their weapons and armor are both made from a kind of enchanted ice.  They wield lances and a wing of Iceclads (which is what the Airya call a squad without the slightest trace of irony) flying right over conventional fortifications is a terrifying sight.  As for their armor, it is reputedly not very comfortable, however, and while the magic ice is nearly as hard as steel even on a warm summer day, it will partially melt.  It will start to drip and soak the wearer through, which is reportedly very uncomfortable and shown to be very irritating."

newmonster "Kavi Archer"
descr "The white-winged Airya serve the Spentas and are said to descend from Yazata who have lain with mortal women.  A militant order known as the Kavi fills the ranged formations of the Airya hosts.  They wear the same armor as the Iceclad but are not called that.  Their bows are made of ordinary wood but the arrows they use are magical and if you are struck by one you will not be happy, as the icy arrowheads will burst into a mist so cold it would probably kill you by itself."

setmaincom "Shah"
classdescr "Before men arrived in Elysium, a people known as the Tur lived in the southernmost deserts of Terra.  These were a fierce and war-like people split into many tribes and petty kingdoms which warred ceaselessly with one another.  Their kings are known as Shahs.  When Ba'al made himself manifest they were his first victims, but several of the Shahs led the remainder of their people to Elysium.^^The Shah lacks the administrative acumen of the Baron and the technology available to him is not quite as advanced, but his warriors are flexible and can fight both at a distance and in close quarters.  When the elephants of Elysium were discovered to be one of the few friendly animals native to Elysium they were soon tamed and repurposed for war.  They can trample through enemy lines and serve as mobile towers for archers.^^Mage-priests of the old faiths supplement that Shah's forces.  They are divided into two orders.  The Athravans venerate the Yazads and Spentas and use storm magic, while the Karapans venerate the Daevas and use blood magic.  Both orders are united in their veneration of fire.  While they no longer war actively with one another, the two orders refuse to work side-by-side with one another.^^Abilities:^Starts in a very well fortified citadel.^Diverse troops including expendable Paighans, elite and flexible Zhayedans and Cataphracts, and massive War Elephants.^The Shah may align himself with one of two orders of magi.^The Athravans collect all sorts of gems to summon Yazatas.^The Karapans collect sacrifices to summon Daevas."

setclassname "Red Wizard"

classdescr "The Wizard was once a member of the Order of Wizards and is the inheritor and guardian of some very old traditions.  Long before humans arrived on Elysium, mankind lived in a realm called Terra.  It was an orderly and peaceful land where the wildlife was meek and civilization flourished.  Magical resources were scarce and the dark arts were banned.  The Order was strong in these days but fell into obscurity during the Dark Ages.  The Wizard has preserved these traditions and built a great keep to guard the collected lore of his Order.  Seeing Elysium fall into disarray, the Wizard has decided to be much more proactive in his duty.^^The Wizard can perform a limited number of rituals that only require mundane materials, but he cannot summon inhuman forces or build constructs to do his bidding.  Instead he must rely on mortal troops and his own spellcraft to conquer Elysium.^^The Wizard lives in a great and majestic tower which has a library to rival the greatest magical academies on Elysium.  He can cast very powerful spells in battle and many magic-users will seek to study in his great library, but in the end he is only human.^^The Wizard has a well-known fondness for pipe weed and has formed a bond with the local Hoburghers, who may occasionally be found in his company.^^Abilities:^Starts in a heavily fortified Wizard's Keep.^The Wizard's Keep doubles as a third-level library.^Has numerous defensive and utility rituals.^Wizards use very potent battle-magic.^Can recruit many apprentices which often come with magic items."
