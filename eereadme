A mod that seeks to tweak and expand on the game without changing its spirit or creating terrible imbalance.

Changelog:

0.1 Preview / High Priestess Build

* Minimalist starting stationary defenders for the Pale One, Druid and Troll King. Should help them stay alive more reliably.
* Tweaked Enchanter rituals. Enchanters always start with Animate Tools, Sword, Bow and Armor. Sculpt Terracotta Soldier does not destroy swamps but costs 5 gold.
* Reduced the cost of all T2 and T3 Pale One rituals by between a fourth and a third. Very slightly buffed Lesser Lava Summoning. Rituals of Mastery left untouched for fear of breaking things.

* Heavily revamped the High Priestess class. 
* Blood Feast rituals are more expensive and instantly destroy a settlement but always summons a living giant commander (and their retinue), who in turn can summon more giants in walled citadels for gold, sacrifices and six action points. Zamzummites can still be acquired via T2 Blood Feast and are key to the Sheol ritpower branch. (Recruitment method subject to change.)
* Ceremony to Baal split into several parts. Summon Creatures of Baal and Summon Greater Creatures of Baal cheaply summons spiders and potentially scorpions in the south. Ceremonies for Baal are desert-only but always summon demons. T2 Ceremony for Baal will never summon Mazzikim on their lonesome, they will always be accompanied by a Lilot or a couple of Se'irim.
* The Sheol ritpower possessed by Zamzummites and Malikum can summon generic spectral units at T1, Lammashta and Ditanu at T2, Malikum at T2 (Zamzummite only, kills Zamzummite and destroys a town) for both sacrifices and hands, and T3 (Malikum only) can plane swap between Elysium and Hades for a large chunk of sacrifices and hands. Malik intentionally does not have the plane shift ability, at least for now.
* Ditanim and Malikum have magic swords. Rephaim, Melqarts and Nephilim have fire resistance 50. Shedim are rearpos (like pikemen) and so slightly less exposed.
* T3 rituals mostly left untouched for now. Watchers cannot be acquired through blood feasts at the moment and so are not accessible. Scorpion Men are only available in deserts. More changes are planned but left alone for now.

0.2 Preview Build 171020
* Ditanu -> mr 7.
* Added event chain (minturn 12 chance 5%) for guaranteed Spirit Guide access for Barbarians.
* Druid starting Venus Traps 2 -> 4.
* Call Gibborim, Anakim more efficient. Slightly reduced probability of Mazzikim results for Ceremony to Baal. Only Anakite Captains can Call Gibborim.
* Added elemental soldiers string to Warlock lesser summoning. Paraelementals are still T2 exclusive.
* Bloodsworn not slow.
* Light cavalry mercenary (fast, javelin) + captain added to Baron, Senator, Enchanter, Warlock, Dwarf Queen and Illusionist.
* Generic Warrior Mage (mounted, front, rearpos, spellweapon ?) available to all classes (with libraries).
* Master Smith added to Baron - allows the promotion of Knights to variants with resistances using gems.
* Bakemono "Summon Oni" ritual will no longer summon Ao or Aka Oni. These have been replaced with a new "Oni" monster which has a greatsword and javelin. Kuro Oni will come with two of these as a retinue.
* Nekromants start with Reanimate Animals. Create Flesh Golem is now a T1 ritual.
* Added one-time Spirit Guide-spawning event for Barbarian, 5% chance per turn after turn 12.

0.3 Preview Build 171028
* Increased Barbarian event chance/turn to 10%.
* Barbarian ancestor summon costs slashed by 20%. Ritual of Grand Mastery down to 1000 herbs (from 1200).
* Amazons tweaked. All troops got +1 armor, Onyx Amazons no longer slow. +5 iron cost for Jade/Garnet Amazons, +10 for Onyx Amazon. Crystal Amazons use composite bows, which have slightly better range, damage and initiative.
* Enchanter tweaks. Apprentic recruitment offer up to 5% (from 3%). Ritual tweaks. Animate Armor no longer free
* Sculpt Terracotta Soldier creates three per cast, costs 20 gold. Create Gargoyles creates two per cast, costs 30 gold, 10 iron. 
* New Sculpt Wooden and Stone Soldiers rituals for the Enchanter, in forests (inc. jungles, but not ancient forests) and mountains respectively. Sculpt Wooden Warriors learned as part of a batch with Sculpt Terracotta Soldiers. Sculpt Stone Soldiers learned as part of a batch with Create Gargoyles.
* Because of how they usually learn several rituals at once, Enchanter's Lesser Ritual of Mastery cost has been raised to 25 (from 15).
* Mercenary cavalry recruited four at a time, frequency slightly decreased, cost is the same (so more per unit).
* Warlock T1 rituals revised further, now always elemental soldiers, regular elementals or rarely a minor spellcaster. Less efficient than the T2 summons still but less likely to induce buyer's remorse. Lesser elementals instead come as a retinue to Champions (at no extra cost).
* Pale One Ritual of Grand Mastery cost down to 180 (from 240). Lava Summoning gives Magma Warriors instead of Lesser Fires.
* Bloodsworn 100% control chance, 50% fire and cold resistance.
* Troll King tweaks. Goblin Shamans and Witchdoctors given extra ritpower that mainly allows them to upgrade goblin troops (+MR, hp & morale, poison arrows). Wolf Kin Reavers are now promoted from Wolf Kin using a ritual. Reduced Rock Troll iron cost to 40.
* Secondary leaders for Troll King. Opt between Goblin Mountain King for large masses of less-terrible goblins or Giant King for more giants, inc. ogre poachers with spears and javelins.
* Secondary leaders for Barbarian. Amazon Queens are available at a low probability if the respective priestesses have been previously recruited. Only one can be recruited at a time and gives reliable access of their Amazon troop type, plus a rarer mounted elite. (You can probably guess what they are if you're familiar with Dominions.)
* Zamzummites can scry for Sheol Temples.

Minor fixes and tweaks. 
* Warrior Mage cost fixed. 
* Spider Familiars much less common for High Priestess (AI armies were swarming with them).

0.4 Preview/Shah Build 171109
* Shah class released.
A hybrid class, the Shah has less elite units than the Baron but they are more versatile. Most units have both melee and ranged attacks and his elite infantry is now slow.
Does not start with any mages but can recruit gem-using Athravans OR sacrifice-using Karapans. If you have one of either or their upgraded forms you cannot recruit their counterparts.
Athravans can cast one of storm magic or pyromancy in combat per turn, while Karapans and Dasturs either blood magic or pyromancy.
Athravans summon Iceclad Airyans and Storm/Frost mages and awe-inspiring Yazata.
Dasturs summon Raptors and Necromancers, and fearsome Daevas.
* Second pass at the High Priestess. More-or-less a complete revamp of the class.
Expanded roster of giants, most accessed through rituals available on their leaders costing gold, sacrifices and extra action points.
A "blood banquet" line of spells that replicate Blood Feasts for three times the cost in sacrifices and an additional gold cost. These are in addition to blood feasts, not a replacement.
Lesser blood feast is gone, though High Priestesses have access to the same Blood Banquet as the Anakite Captain that allows them to more expensively replicate it (with a few extra summon results).
Ceremony/demon-summoning rituals can also be cast in temples.
Necromancy branch further expanded but mostly for flavour (i.e. spectral Ba'alites). Fossil warriors can also be summoned in deserts. Biggest change is that Zamzummites are no longer directly accessible, instead an Emite must be acquired with the Call Anakites ritual (available to Adons and Melqarts) and upgraded.
New giants include a Gibbor scout, Qedesim (lvl-1 Dark Prayers), Gibbor archers, occasional Dawn Guard Anakites in smaller numbers than regular Anakites. Anakite Elders accessible as Emites, upgrade in libraries for gold to Sages. Biggest addition is the Belus from T3 Blood Feasts or Banquets. All three of these use High Arcana.
Ba'al revamped. One spellweapon replaced with Command 3. Only Ba'al can summon Nephilim (in deserts).
Watchers completely revamped. Now you must scry for their infernal prison using the Nephilim. Ba'al can create an infernal gateway in deserts and target the area around the Pit. There are six unique Watchers which can be summoned at the Pit itself by Ba'al, all of which are very powerful. You will have to fight the Infernal Powers, though.
* Spirit sight for Ghost Captains.
* All spectral undead given Unaging.
* Master Smiths now give magic swords to promoted knights as well. Unicorn knights can also be upgraded (and are given higher priority).
* New generic mage, the Chartmaker (who can become a Navigator and then a Stormcaller in libraries). These can scry for ports and allow you to sail between different ports. This costs gold and a lot of AP.
* Mercenaries tweaked. First a commander is hired and then other mercenary recruitment offers will appear. The basic mercenary line only includes light cavalry for now.
* Turtle Tribe/Merman mercenaries. Grant limited amphibious capabilities to all classes.

0.41 Shah Hotfix Build 171110
* Bugfixes, ritual descriptions.


Make a new, full changelog for 0.5

Design for 0.5:
* Implement new mercenary system. Expensive but rare options, sometimes with leaders attached, comprised of units designed to expand the buyer's options.
Mercenaries should include:
Everyone: Mermen w/ captain, 
Civilized: humanbred-alike axe throwers, light spear/javelin cavalry w/ captain,
Desert (Ba'al/Illusionist): desert raiders sword/bow cavalry w/ captain,

* Unlockable recruits:
Necromancer: Wraiths (w/ Hands recxcost) if in possession of a Wraith Lord or King. Flat rate?

* Framework for invisible flag system?

0.5 Alpha Build 18xxxx
* 

0.4 design
* Implementing the Shah, finally.

* Terracotta cost -> 10 gold (from 20).
* Second run at the High Priestess. More-or-less a complete revamp of the class' mechanics once I'm done. 
Blood feasts revamped, lesser blood feast gone completely, though a Blood Banquet ritual at T2 (more expensive) emulates its functionality.
Expanded roster of giants accessed through their leaders. Blood Feast spells leave ruins. Spells available to giant lords (Adon, Melqart, the new Belus) allow duplication of Blood Spell effect at dramatically higher cost.
Qedesim, gibbor archers and scouts. Anakite Emites, which upgrade into Zamzummim. High Arcana Anakite Elders, Sages, and Rephaite Belusim. Anakite Dawn Guards. Blood feasts more expensive?
New undead units. Fossil warriors. More appropriate spectral units. 
Add central-only scorpion summons to Creatures rituals, less efficient than southern.
T1 & T2 Ceremonies have temple-only variant copies (learned at the same time) at a slight increase in cost, so you can always summon demons in your starting citadel and in any temples you find outside the south.
Baal replaces one spellweapon /w Command 3. New levels for Ba'alite rituals, Nephil and Ba'al-exclusive, respectively. Invade Hell to release revamped Grigori?
Watchers can only be summoned at a Pit in the Inferno.

Polish up the Barbarian's and Troll King's new stuff.
Zotz for the Priest King.
Spirit Sight for Hades recruitables.
Unaging for most spectral undead.
Master Smith gives magic swords as well and can also upgrade Unicorn Knights (and will prioritize them first).
Generic Chartmaker/Navigator/Stormcaller that can scry for ports and "sail" (teleport at high AP cost) from port to port at a suitable fee in gold.
Mermen mercenaries. Low probability of recruiting a Turtle Chief, in turn gives recruitment offers for Turtle Warriors and Mermages (even without libraries, though quite rare).
Mercenary cavalry tweaked to follow the same model. Recruit a Mercenary Captain first to get offers for mercenary cavalry. More units may follow in the future.
Stone Soldiers for the Enchanter significantly slower, 6 AP per. (That's what you get for unmatched cost-efficiency.)

0.5?
More terrains and indies spawned in turn 0?
